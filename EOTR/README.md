# DC East of the River (EOTR)

## Background
For several years, I lived in an area of Washington, DC known as East of the River (EOTR) due to its location east of the Anacostia River.

History of EOTR
Current state of DC and EOTR (politics, housing, jobs, etc.)
Assumptions (EOTR is "sketchy", All of DC is unaffordable, EOTR doesn't have good metro access or public transportation)

In 2015, [Zumper](https://www.zumper.com/blog/2015/03/d-c-4th-expensive-city-rent-february/) published a map of the median price of 1-bedroom rentals in DC by neighborhood. Interestingly, the map excluded the entire area EOTR, while including neighborhoods in Northern Virginia and Maryland that are not considered part of "DC proper". This misleading map was widely circulated and re-published on several websites frequented by DC residents. 

Zumper later acknowledged their mistake and edited the map, but lumped everything EOTR together and labeled it as one neighborhood "Anacostia". After receiving additional criticism, Zumper eventually divided the EOTR neighbhorhoods into two - Deanwood (North EOTR, mostly Ward 7) and Anacostia (South EOTR, mostly Ward 8). While an improvement, the update is still misleading. Zumper's justification for lumping everything EOTR into these two all-encompassing neighborhoods was that there was insufficient data on rentals available in these areas to do a further breakdown.

Upon further research, Zumper's maps of rental prices in other major US cities are incorrect and misleading. There seems to be little accountability or incentive for them to fix these mistakes. In fact, [they are now official partners of Facebook to provide home rental listings on the social media site's Marketplace.](https://www.zumper.com/blog/2017/11/zumper-facebook-marketplace/) 

## My Analysis
This analysis uses publicly provided data from DC Government. Of particular interest is the current state of EOTR business and economic development, as compared to the rest of DC.

## Data Sources
Data from [opendata.dc.gov](http://opendata.dc.gov) were used

## Methodology
Used R to analyze and visualize data

## Interesting Findings
* Grocery stores are sparse EOTR
* Bikeshares, metro access, and public transportation are not as sparse EOTR
* No current business improvement bids taking place EOTR, as opposed to similar areas of DC undergoing rapid development

## Future Work
Combine with other DC open datasets

## Lessons Learned


## Final Thoughts
Maybe it's a good thing that the neighborhood I treasure still hasn't 'turned', as it is still affordable relative to other DC area neighborhoods.

An inaccurate/insensitive data visualization (e.g., maps) can perpetuate false assumptions by providing misleading data. This effort has refueled my passion for "cartographic justice".
