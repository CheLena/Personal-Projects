## Personal Projects

This repository is a collection of my data science projects, reflecting my interest in particular topics and methodologies. 

### Project Descriptions

#### [Rick and Morty Episode Rankings](https://github.com/CheLena/Personal-Projects/tree/master/Rick_And_Morty)
* Interested in how various websites ranked episodes of the popular animated show
* Collected rankings of up to 31 episodes (as of November 2018) from various websites, blogs, forums
* Applied different metrics to summarize ranks and figure out which episodes are most popular, least popular, and most controversial (inconsistent/variable rankings)

#### [East of the River DC](https://github.com/CheLena/Personal-Projects/tree/master/EOTR)
* Interested in business and economic development in a largely un-gentrified/under-developed area of Washington, DC
* Some recent infographic maps have omitted this part of the city as if the data don't exist or don't matter
* Historically, it is considered an undesirable, 'sketchy' area
* It is also historically majority African-American, with a lower average income compared to other parts of DC
* Used data from opendata.dc.gov
* This project has re-ignited my passion for cartographic justice

#### [Data Science Programs](https://github.com/CheLena/Personal-Projects/tree/master/DataSciBootcamps)
* Scraped data on data science career accelerator programs
* Created structured datasets that include participants' academic background, project descriptions, and hiring company
* Compared information on program partcipants and their projects
* Discovered that these programs attract participants from Physics-related academic backgrounds who have attained at least a PhD
* Some programs offer the option to participate remotely
* Hot project topics include NLP, image classification, mapping, and recommender systems

#### [Data Explorer Using Shiny](https://github.com/CheLena/Personal-Projects/tree/master/ShinyExplorer)
* Built an interactive Shiny app to plot comparisons of variables
* Used publicly available data from the site [IMDb](https://imdb.com), as provided by [Kaggle](https://kaggle.com)
* This app decreases time spent programming to quickly dive into a dataset and explore relationships between variables
* I plan to iteratively add features to this Shiny app to make it more useful and applicable to other types of datasets

### Tools Used
