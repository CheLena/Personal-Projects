## Personal Projects

This repository is a collection of my data science projects. 

### Project Descriptions

#### East of the River DC
* Interested in business and economic development in a largely un-gentrified area of Washington, DC
* Some recent infographic maps have omitted this part of the city as if the data don't exist or don't matter
* Historically, it is considered an undesirable, 'sketchy' area
* It is also historically majority African-American, with a lower average income compared to other parts of DC
* Used data from opendata.dc.gov
* This project has re-ignited my passion for cartographic justice

#### Data Science Programs
* Scraped data on data science career accelerator programs
* Created structured datasets that include participants' academic background, project descriptions, and hiring company
* Compared program partcipants
* Discovered that these programs attract participants from Physics-related academic backgrounds who have attained at least a PhD
* Some programs offer the option to participate remotely

### Tools Used
* R/R Studio
* Python/Jupyter Notebook
* Venngage
